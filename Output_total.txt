tesla or otherwise matters to the environment we all share every time someone chooses electric the future gets a little bit brighter  if not tesla please take a look at these other options  httpstcofzvnlgwyga and because electricity costs much less than gasoline a model 3 can cost about 1000 less per year to operate because its electric there are no oil changes smog checks tuneups fuel

improved ride comfort lower wind noise amp many other small improvements will request that they test current production electrekco fredericlambert looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update

idea  mactechgenius that is true electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines you need an electric motor just to start a gas engine tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front amp a motor in rear one is optimized for power amp one for range car drives fine even if a motor breaks down helps ensure you make it to your destination amp dont get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions cost of normal dual motor awd option is 5k range is also 310 miles takes 060mph to 45 sec amp top speed to 140 mph ppathole black amp white interior available only for model 3 performance initially due to limited parts availability will broaden over time tesla awd is dual motor so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks cost of all options wheels paint etc

layonoverwhale stage 1 would reach low earth orbit if not hefting a second stage but payload would be greatly reduced jimmyvosika actually didnt get environmental approval in time but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed if speed at stage separation gt 6000 kmhr with a ship no need to zero out lateral velocity so can stage at up to 9000 kmh ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs just not physically possible to return to launch site as mentioned before ship landings are needed for high velocity missions altitude amp distance dont mean much for orbit all about speed mbhnyc steel collet well at least the pieces were bigger this time wont be last rud but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing  httpstcow007tccanj unclegus probably however that was not what prevented it being good touchdown speed was ok but a leg lockout didnt latch so it tipped over after landing definitely harder to land on a ship similar to an aircraft carrier vs

100 of that into spacex tesla amp solarcity if consumption is low then the tax is proportionately low we should prob not have tax on basic foods amp critical meds ponder68 carbon produced by a spacex rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight no we should not be exempt net of gas savings a tesla is 550 to 600month with down payment taken care of by tax credits maybe less costly then it first seems yes am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created market will then achieve best solution trees are net consumers of co2 so technically we would pay them money  exactly seems crazy to risk the co2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases ie consumption much better to emphasize the latter maxmberger the collective wisdom of the market is usually not always better than the smartest govt regulator me amp other private money funded tesla for first 7 years got ipo govt money for 3 now paid back yes carbon tax would be a better way grayj there should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years just like we do a census weight of scientific evidence taxes dont ban a purchase they just increase cost am against bans except in extreme cases exactly better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome instead of subsidizing particular solution paths
